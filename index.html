<p> I'm a computer science major, and I'm not entirely certain about my career path with this degree. Computer science is a vast field with various exciting areas like AI, cybersecurity, and software development. I often find myself torn between these options, unsure of which one to pursue. Nevertheless, I consider this uncertainty as an opportunity to explore and discover my true passions within the computer science domain. I'm embracing this ambiguity and taking each step in my computer science journey with an open mind, eager to uncover where my skills and interests will ultimately guide me.</p>
<p> In the ever-evolving world of technology, the possibilities within computer science are endless. As a student, it's natural to feel unsure about the specific career direction to take. I believe that the journey of exploration is just as important as the destination itself. So, I'm approaching my computer science studies with a sense of curiosity and a willingness to experiment. I'm excited to see how this journey will shape my future and help me find my niche in this dynamic field..</p>

<h2>A Pound of Flesh.</h2>

<p>One of my all-time favorite books is "The Merchant of Venice" by William Shakespeare, particularly the part where a character named Shylock asks for a pound of flesh as collateral for a loan. This story is fascinating because it makes us think about fairness and kindness. Shylock's demand shows us how sometimes people can be very focused on getting what they're owed, even if it seems cruel. But there's another character named Portia who gives a powerful speech in court, which makes us wonder if being merciful and forgiving is more important than following strict rules. It's a deep and timeless story about justice and forgiveness that continues to be relevant today. </p>
<p>As someone with a computer science degree, I've often pondered how to merge my passion for technology with my love for literature. The beauty of Shakespeare's works is that they offer valuable insights into human nature and complex moral dilemmas, which can be analyzed and understood using computational methods. Perhaps, in the future, I can explore how data analytics and natural language processing can shed new light on the characters and themes in Shakespearean literature, creating a bridge between two seemingly disparate worlds. This way, I can combine my fascination with the world of algorithms and code with the profound narratives and timeless wisdom found in literature like "The Merchant of Venice.".</p>
